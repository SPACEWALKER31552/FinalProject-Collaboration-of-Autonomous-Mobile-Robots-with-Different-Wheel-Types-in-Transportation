My Bachelor 's Degree Final Project at KMUTT (PRE496-PRE497)


Abstract: This study proposes a cooperative transportation system, which uses multiple autonomous mobile robots with different wheel types cooperating together to transport a rigid object. The system uses a leader-follower formation control strategy, by using the non-holonomic leading the way while the holonomic AMRs follow. The object is assumed as a constraint between the robots, and the cooperation is tested using a designed destination point, in which each follower robot receives commands from the leader sent through the laptop. To walk straight, all robots receive the same command, but for rotating, leader robot must evaluate the command for the follower robots by the designed method. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is used for the development of the robots and for standard communication. The proposed method is validated through simulation tasks using autonomous mobile robots with different wheel types.

Introduction: In recent years, the use of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) has become increasingly widespread across a wide range of industries, especially in transportation and material handling. While AMRs have revolutionized manufacturing, logistics, and other areas, they often operate independently of one another, limiting their effectiveness in certain applications. Cooperative autonomous mobile robots (C-AMRs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem. Cooperative AMRs are designed to work together in a coordinated fashion to accomplish shared tasks, such as material handling or transportation of a heavy object [1],[2]. This cooperative approach offers numerous advantages over traditional AMRs. Firstly, C-AMRs can improve efficiency and productivity by working together to perform tasks that are difficult or impossible for individual robots to accomplish alone. For example, C-AMRs can work together to move large or heavy objects, or to navigate complex environments. Secondly, C-AMRs can enhance safety by sharing information and coordinating movements, reducing the risk of collisions or other accidents. Additionally, C-AMRs can provide greater flexibility and adaptability by coordinating their movements and tasks in real-time, enabling them to respond quickly to changing conditions.
