The file name "fromleader" and "fromleaderbackup" in this directory is to represent the place that the files should be but in my project.I didn't edit the files from the RasberryPi everytime the
program needed to change.I changed it from the Laptop and download from the Laptop,so the real one is in the Laptop section.
